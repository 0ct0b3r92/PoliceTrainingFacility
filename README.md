# Police Training Facility

I put this together because I'm tired of seeing so many communities copy the DOJ way of training as if it's
<br>the proper way of doing things.  IT'S NOT!  DOJ claims realism and it's anything but real.  I'm sorry to
<br>burst anyone's bubble, but real EVOC training does not happen on city streets.
<br><br>
So I give you this ymap.  This does take up half of the two main runways at LSIA as well as one of the hangers.
<br>If you only have one server, you can turn these off as and only turn them on when needed for training.
<br>The EVOC course and the killhouse are two separate ymaps so that you have the ability to use only what
<br>you need to use if you choose, just by simply removing one of the files.
<br>I have also included the menyoo .xml files so that you can make any changes you wish.  These were created
<br>in single player using the menyoo spooner.  You can find menyoo on GTA5 Mods.
<br><br>
The EVOC course was laid out by a 20 year police veteran who also spent time as an FTO.
<br><br>
The killhouse was laidout by a trained SRT officer.
